# TwitchMassBan
A small java program that reads an input file and writes a whole bunch  of ban statements in your chat window

it's not a very complicated program, you just need the java installed, (Java 8 was used to compile the application).

The application needs a text file called **banlist.txt** to be placed in the same location as the jar file. Just place the names of users into this list. One name per line.

To run the file, open up Command Prompt (or terminal) and run the following

```java -jar TwitchMassBan.jar```

Follow the on-screen prompt
